======================================================================================

v1.0: Release Notes
-------------------
- ICAROUS runs on a companion computer with the pixhawk flight controller. ICAROUS has been
  extensively tested using the Ardupilot flight stack.
- C++ and Java implementations of ICAROUS are available.
- Baseline ICAROUS functionalities for simple waypoint missions:
  - Prevent keep-in geofence violation (Bounce back and continue to next feasible waypoint).
  - Prevent keep-out geofence violation (Replan flight plan to avoid keep-out fence).
  - Detect and Avoid functionality (Autonomously avoid traffic and geofences).
  - Flight plan deviation monitoring (Autonomously returns back to nearest point on flightplan).
- Track a user defined object.
