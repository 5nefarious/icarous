Integrated Configurable Algorithms for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems
========

This software release contains ICAROUS and PolyCARP software
distributions.

ICAROUS is a software architecture that enables the robust integration
of mission specific software modules and highly assured core software
modules for building safety-centric autonomous unmanned aircraft
applications. The set of core software modules include formally
verified algorithms that (1) detect, monitor, and control conformance
to safety criteria; (2) avoid stationary obstacles and maintain a safe
distance from other users of the airspace; and (3) compute resolution
and recovery maneuvers, autonomously executed by the autopilot, when
safety criteria are violated or about to be violated.

PolyCARP (Algorithms and Software for Computations with Polygons)
is a package of algorithms, including both their formal
models and software implementations, for computing containment,
collision, resolution, and recovery information for polygons. The
intended applications of PolyCARP are related, but not limited, to
safety critical systems in air traffic management.
